# Trial_Repository
This is a trial repository for the Git Hub class
This is where the read-me file is amended. For example, this is where I would leave comments about this project and things I have changed in it. I did this in the computer class as practice and then I saved it. 
I am now editing the branch from the Read me file so that I can see what happens when I merge the two files back together. This exercise is also allowing me to practice my typing (which I must admit is getting pretty good, even if I do say so myself).
